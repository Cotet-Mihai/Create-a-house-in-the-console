# Build a house in the console
 A small project in which a house is built in the cantilever, the perimeter and the area are calculated with different functionalities

"Build a house in the console" is a console application written in C++ that allows users to create and modify virtual houses using simple operations. By leveraging object-oriented programming and user interaction concepts, the project provides a straightforward and efficient way to experiment with house design in a virtual environment.

Through a set of essential functionalities, users can:

    Input the desired size of the house.
    Modify the dimensions of the house by increasing or decreasing.
    Change the symbols used for borders and interior.
    Visualize the created houses and receive a summary of the details.

The project employs classes and methods to organize and manage the data and functionalities, thus offering modular and easy-to-understand code to encourage learning and experimentation with object-oriented programming.
